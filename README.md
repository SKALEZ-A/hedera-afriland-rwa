# Track 1: Onchain Finance & RWA Tokenization
## Project: AfriLand - Tokenized Real Estate Investment Platform

### üéØ Project Overview
AfriLand is a revolutionary platform that tokenizes African real estate assets, enabling fractional ownership and cross-border investment. Built on Hedera's fast, secure, and low-cost network, it democratizes real estate investment across Africa while providing liquidity to traditionally illiquid assets.

### üåç Problem Statement
- **Limited Access**: 90% of Africans cannot afford to invest in prime real estate
- **Cross-Border Barriers**: Complex regulations prevent pan-African real estate investment
- **Liquidity Issues**: Real estate investments are traditionally illiquid
- **Trust Deficit**: Lack of transparent, verifiable property records
- **Capital Flight**: African wealth often flows to foreign real estate markets

### üí° Solution Architecture

#### Core Features
1. **Property Tokenization Engine**
   - Convert real estate assets into HTS (Hedera Token Service) tokens
   - Each property becomes a collection of fungible tokens representing ownership shares
   - Smart contracts handle dividend distribution and governance

2. **KYC/AML Compliance Layer**
   - Integration with African identity verification systems
   - Automated compliance checks using Hedera Consensus Service
   - Real-time regulatory reporting

3. **Cross-Border Payment Rails**
   - Multi-currency support (USD, EUR, local African currencies)
   - Integration with mobile money systems (M-Pesa, MTN Mobile Money)
   - Instant settlement using HBAR and stablecoins

4. **Property Verification Oracle**
