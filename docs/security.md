# Security Documentation

## Overview

GlobalLand RWA Platform implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data, financial transactions, and blockchain operations. This document outlines the security architecture, implemented controls, and best practices.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

The platform implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Network Security**: HTTPS enforcement, security headers, CORS protection
2. **Application Security**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
3. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure key management
4. **Infrastructure Security**: Secure deployment, monitoring, backup procedures
5. **Compliance**: Audit logging, regulatory compliance, data protection

### Security Services

#### 1. Encryption Service (`EncryptionService`)

**Purpose**: Handles all cryptographic operations including data encryption, password hashing, and digital signatures.

**Features**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- bcrypt password hashing with configurable salt rounds
- HMAC signatures for data integrity
- Secure random token generation
- Property-specific encryption keys

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Encrypt sensitive data
const encrypted = EncryptionService.encrypt(sensitiveData);

// Hash passwords
const hash = await EncryptionService.hashPassword(password);

// Create digital signature
const signature = EncryptionService.createSignature(data, secret);
```

#### 2. Audit Service (`AuditService`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security monitoring.

**Features**:
- Structured audit event logging
- Encrypted storage of sensitive audit data
- Compliance report generation
- Audit trail integrity verification
- Automatic log archival

**Event Types**:
- User actions (login, registration, profile changes)
- Financial transactions (investments, payments, dividends)
- Blockchain operations (token transfers, smart contract calls)
- Security events (failed logins, suspicious activity)
- Compliance events (KYC status changes, AML screening)

#### 3. Backup Service (`BackupService`)

**Purpose**: Automated backup and disaster recovery procedures.

**Features**:
- Scheduled full and incremental backups
- Encrypted backup storage
- Cloud storage integration (AWS S3)
- Backup integrity verification
- Automated retention policy enforcement

**Configuration**:
```typescript
const backupConfig = {
  schedule: '0 2 * * *', // Daily at 2 AM
  retentionDays: 30,
  encryptBackups: true,
  uploadToCloud: true,
  cloudProvider: 'aws'
};
```

#### 4. Security Testing Service (`SecurityTestingService`)

**Purpose**: Automated security vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

**Test Categories**:
- Input validation and SQL injection protection
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data protection and encryption
- Network security and headers
- Configuration security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Security Controls

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Implementation**:
- Server-side validation using express-validator
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- File upload validation and restrictions

**Example**:
```typescript
// Input validation middleware
export const validateUserInput = [
  body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
  body('password').isLength({ min: 8 }).matches(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])/),
  handleValidationErrors
];
```

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

**Multi-Factor Authentication**:
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Optional 2FA using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- Biometric authentication support for mobile apps

**Authorization**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Resource-level permissions
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication

**Session Management**:
- Secure session configuration
- Session timeout and renewal
- Concurrent session limits

### 3. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

**Rate Limiting Tiers**:
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- Investment operations: 10 requests per minute
- File uploads: 5 uploads per hour

**DDoS Protection**:
- Progressive delay for suspicious traffic
- IP-based blocking for malicious actors
- User-agent filtering for bot detection

### 4. Data Protection

**Encryption at Rest**:
- Database encryption using PostgreSQL TDE
- File encryption for document storage
- Encrypted backup storage

**Encryption in Transit**:
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Certificate pinning for mobile apps
- Secure WebSocket connections

**Key Management**:
- Environment-based key storage
- Key rotation procedures
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for production

### 5. Security Headers

**Implemented Headers**:
```typescript
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
