# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GlobalLand is a revolutionary real estate tokenization platform built on Hedera Hashgraph that enables fractional ownership of global real estate assets, starting with high-yield African markets. The platform democratizes real estate investment by allowing users to invest as little as $10 in premium properties, while providing liquidity to traditionally illiquid assets through blockchain tokenization.

The platform addresses the critical problem that 90% of people cannot afford prime real estate investments, cross-border investment barriers, and lack of transparency in property records. By leveraging Hedera's fast, secure, and low-cost network, GlobalLand creates a seamless investment experience with sub-3 second transactions and $0.0001 fees.
